# Little Lemon Restaurant Website
I am simulating the existence of a new restaurant - Little Lemon, which has recently opened in Chicago, and it requires a website to showcase its restaurant content or enable online reservations. This React project aims to build such a restaurant website. <br>
You can view the website on following URL: **https://chungyingho.github.io/Little-Lemon/**

### Features
This website has a total of two routes: the home page and the reservation page.
* Home page: Clicking on **"Reservations"** in the navbar or the **"Reserve a Table"** button in the banner will both lead to the reservation page.
* Reservation page: There is a simple form to simulate the reservation process, and when the user clicks the **"Make Your Reservation"** button, a popup window will appear displaying the information the user just entered.
